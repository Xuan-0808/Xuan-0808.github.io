## About Me
<br>Here is **Xuan Li (李璇)**.<br>
I am a master in **Public Health** at Tsinghua University (China) and was a bachelor in **Economic Statistics** at Renmin University of China. I am extremely fortunate to be supervised by [Kun Tang](https://vsph.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1047.htm). Here is my [Resume](./file/CV_2pages.pdf).

## Research Interests
My current research focuses on global health, maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, and health big data. <br>
Health is a science of multi-disciplinary and practice-based. I firmly hold that "Health in all, and all for health".
